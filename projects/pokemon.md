This was the final project in our AP Computer Science class and we decided upon making a small text-based adventure game about Pokemon. This game included different Pokemon types, two little towns to explore, and a forest between the towns. 

This game is all on Python using the Tkinter GUI. In order for the user to be able to choose what they wanted to do, we had an OregonTrail-like number system where the user would type out a number to decide what they wanted to do.
