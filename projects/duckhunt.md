summary: "My group developed a Duckhunt parody game for a high school project."
---

In this AP Computer Science class, my group and I decided to create a parody/copy of the popular old-school game called Duckhunt. 

The entirety of this game was created with Python using the turtle graphics module to create a fully functional game of Duckhunt. It consists of the Duckhunt background, the ducks, and even the dog itself. My role in this project was to create the start screen of the game and to determine the movement of the duck objects when they show up on the screen to be shot. I also was in charge of creating the dog object which was a little easter egg that we added to the game.
