This was a solo assignment where we had to create a game using the turtle module in Python. This game is Catch a Turtle. The aim of the game is to click on the newly appeared turtle that was on the screen and try to get as many as possible before the time runs out. 

The trick with this game is that whenever you click on the turtle, it stamps the canvas and you have to pay attention to where the newly made turtle shows up so you are able to click on it. I also named the turtle Leonardo as a reference to the ninja turtles.
