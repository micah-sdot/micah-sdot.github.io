This was a project for
## My Role
As I said, this was a solo assignment and I worked on this by myself. I did this all using the Turtle module in Python. The Turtle module has a thing where you can change the cursor shape and I just changed the cursor into the form of a turtle. I also named the turtle Leonardo as a reference to the ninja turtles.
