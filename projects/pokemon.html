<h2 id="what-was-it">What was it?</h2>
<p>This was the final project in our AP Computer Science class and we decided upon making a small text-based adventure game about Pokemon. This game included different Pokemon types, two little towns to explore, and a forest between the towns. This game is all on Python using the Tkinter GUI. In order for the user to be able to choose what they wanted to do, we had an OregonTrail-like number system where the user would type out a number to decide what they wanted to do.</p>
<h2 id="my-role">My Role</h2>
<p>My role in this was to create one of the towns that you were able to visit. All it was was just different interactions that you could have while inside a town before leaving to go out into the forest where you could encounter different things.</p>
<h2 id="problems-and-fixes">Problems and Fixes</h2>
<p>The biggest problem I remember had to do with the battle system. Sometimes their health would go below zero and we could not figure out why they would not faint. In the end, it was just a mix-up of less than and greater than signs.</p>
