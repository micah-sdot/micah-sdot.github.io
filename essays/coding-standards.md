## What are Coding Standards?

From the start when I started to learn how to code, I always had to follow a set of “rules” which were coding standards. In a way, I think following these coding standards allowed me to understand how programming works faster because, for every coding standard, there is a reason why it should be followed. There is a reason why a variable should relate to what its purpose is, there is a reason why gets() is not usually used in C because of security reasons. Knowing some of this would make me curious as to why a certain thing is done, and I would end up learning more than what I actually intended to learn in the first place.

Since we will most likely be working with other people in our careers, it will be important for all of us to follow the same coding standards, so we are able to easily help each other when it comes time to look at each other's code. I have collaborated with many different people trying to learn how to program just like myself, and I have seen many different types of ways that they code. Some of them have been good, and some of them have been bad. Most of the time, I found that it was a lot easier to work with those who had neater code as it was easy to identify problems, especially in larger programs.

## How I feel about ESLint?

I have been using ESLint for about a week, and it is really nice when it comes to coding style because it is easy to just see if a certain line is not within coding standards and be able to click on it to go away. It makes it easy for me to be able to basically type what I want and still be able to make sure that my code follows coding standards. I really enjoy seeing that green check mark in IntelliJ and it is so easy to follow coding standards now with just a click.
