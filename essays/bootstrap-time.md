## Initial Thoughts on Bootstrap
When we first started to use the Bootstrap framework after initially learning about HTML and CSS, I thought of Bootstrap as a way to “shortcut” the styling of the site. I was dead wrong. In a way, it definitely makes it more accessible. Containers are a great way to add padding without having to add it manually. The classes of Bootstrap make it easier to format an HTML file, but there are so many classes that it could take a long time to actually format the file if you do not know how each class works. Since I am just starting out with Bootstrap and I do not know a lot of classes, it takes me a very long time to create the product that I want. I know eventually I will get comfortable with Bootstrap and I will be able to create a website in a snap. 

## How not to deal with Bootstrap
In my experience, you definitely do not want to panic and you definitely want to take your time when dealing with Bootstrap, especially when you are being timed. I have had many times where I would get frustrated with Bootstrap because I would change things with the classes and look at the website and nothing would change at all. I would basically just do the same things over and over again to achieve the same results when I expect something different. It is important to take your time and know what you are changing so you do not end up making the same mistakes over and over again. 

## Conclusion
In the end, however, looking at a website I made with Bootstrap, compared to one written without it, there would be a lot less CSS written than the one without. It might also look nicer than the one without as well considering how Bootstrap formats things.
